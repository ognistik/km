## Overview

This repository contains my personal collection of Keyboard Maestro macros. These macros are designed to enhance productivity and automate various tasks on my system.

## Importing Macros

To import these macros, you'll need the [Macro Repository tool](https://github.com/dagware/DanThomas/blob/master/MacroRepository/MacroRepository.md) created by Dan Thomas. This utility provides an excellent way to:

- Backup Keyboard Maestro macros

- External scripts
- Specific file dependencies
- Custom configurations
